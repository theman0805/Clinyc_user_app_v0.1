# Screens Directory

App screens (views) go here.

## Organization

Screens should be:

- Organized by feature
- Connected to navigation
- Focused on layout and composition of components
- Minimal business logic (defer to contexts and services)

Consider creating subdirectories for related screens (e.g., authentication, profile, cases).
