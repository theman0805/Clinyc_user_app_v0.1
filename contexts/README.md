# Contexts Directory

React Context providers go here.

## Common Contexts

- **AuthContext**: Authentication state management
- **ThemeContext**: Theme management
- **LoadingContext**: Global loading states
- **NotificationContext**: Notification system

Contexts should handle app-wide state that needs to be accessible across multiple components.
